This project dives into the factors affecting stress levels among students, drawing insights from data collected from high school and college students at Tribhuvan University, Nepal. Our dataset has a wide array of factors, including psychological, physiological, environmental, academic, and social aspects, all potentially influencing stress levels. Through meticulous data analysis and the application of machine learning techniques, our goal is to uncover the main predictors of stress and develop a reliable model for estimating stress scores.

We employ two main predictive models: multiple regression and random forest regression to predict stress levels. The multiple regression model allows us to examine the linear relationships between various factors and stress levels, while the random forest regression model offers a more sophisticated approach by considering the interplay of multiple factors simultaneously.

We built two functions to train and visualize data. The former function takes training and testing datasets to train a multiple regression model, calculate its R-squared value and returns the model. The model returned can be plugged into the graphing function to visualize our findings. The graphing function uses residplot and barplot functions from seaborn library to to plot the residuals and feature importance for each category. The same was done using a Random Forest Regressor. 

We then use the most contributing features form each of the categories and build a new multiple regression and random forest regression model to see which one performs better. Even though they both has similar R-squared values for each category separately, the Random Forest Regression performs significantly better using the top features. 

Upon constructing and fine-tuning our predictive models, we assess their performance in accurately estimating stress scores. While both the multiple regression and random forest regression models demonstrate promising results, the latter showcases better performance in predicting stress determinants. So, this random forest regression model is used to make a function that predicts the stress levels from user inputs. The function takes into consideration the top feature from each category: Self-Esteem, Sleep Quality, Safety, Teacher-Student Relationship, Bullying as numerical values and calculates the stress level using our model and returns it.

In conclusion, our project sheds light on the multifaceted nature of student stress at Tribhuvan University, Nepal, by examining various factors including psychology, physiology, environment, academics, and social aspects. Through rigorous data analysis and machine learning techniques, we've developed predictive models that accurately estimate stress scores. While both multiple regression and random forest regression models showed promise, the latter proved more effective in capturing the intricacies of stress determinants. By identifying key features from each category, our study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to stress prediction. These findings offer valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and mental health professionals in fostering supportive environments and targeted interventions to enhance student well-being.
